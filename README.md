My third project is dedicated to data exploration, calculation and visualization with Python. The focus here is on the demonstration of my technical and problem-solving skills. </br> 
The subject of analysis is the Facebook Ads campaigns data for the years 2021-2022. There are 4 tasks:</br> 
<ul>
<li> To prepare a dataset with SQL </li>
<li> To show the effectiveness (ROMI) of each campaign for the year 2021, and compare it with spending for them. </li>
<li> To analyze dependency among the marketing metrics (CPC, CPM, CTR, ROMI). That included creating a correlation matrix and placing several different subplots to one figure. </li> 
<li> To visualize the relationship of the metric “value” on the defined metric(s). </li> </ul></br> 
The complete project description and it's results are in PDF-document <a href="https://github.com/olenapetrova-da/Python_FbAds-Analysis/blob/main/CaseStudy_Python.pdf">CaseStudy_Python.pdf</a>. </br> 
The Python code is in <a href="Fb_ads.ipynb"> Fb_ads.ipynb </a>. The code file includes more tasks than were required for the Case Study. </br>
